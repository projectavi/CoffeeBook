# CoffeeBook
 
A quick on-the-run project to document the tastes and experiences of different coffees at different cafes.

This was built because I felt that Excel was a little too restrictive for me to build my database of coffee rankings on there.

Running on a simple Svelte webapp, CoffeeBook allows anyone to create their own coffee experience database with their own ranking system and rating calculation formula, based on what is most important to them, all accessible through a one-step Google account login system.

Currently, the UI is a little thrown together, but that will be remedied in the future. There are also currently limited data visualisation and insight tools however one can view tables of all the cafes they have entered and tables of all the drinks too. It is also possible to view everyone else's aggregated information on the global view, which is slated for major expansions into viewing specific other peoples rankings and performing other analysis metrics on the coffee data because, why not.

To use the application, visit https://coffeebook.netlify.app, which is consistently updated.
